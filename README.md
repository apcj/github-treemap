Enclosure diagrams use containment to represent the hierarchy. Although circle packing is not as space-efficient as a treemap, it better reveals the hierarchy. Implementation based on work by [Jeff Heer](http://jheer.org/). Data shows the [Flare](http://flare.prefuse.org/) class hierarchy, also courtesy Jeff Heer.
